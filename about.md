I am a Data and AI architect with a background spanning data, AI, DevOps, telemetry and observability, infrastructure, and security across Windows and Linux. I've developed into a jack of all trades, due to my startup experience in U.S. Healthcare and IoT. 

At present, I work as a Data and AI Architect with Microsoft. Opinions on this site are my own.
